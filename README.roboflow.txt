Face-Mask-Detection-YOLOv5 - v1 FaceMaskDetectionYOLOv5 Dataset 20210612 113pm
==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on June 12, 2021 at 12:14 PM GMT

It includes 2036 images.
Cherifa are annotated in YOLO v3 Darknet format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 10 pixels
